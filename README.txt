Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous Mod

Fixes the behavior of the Ring of Guiding Star to match the description:
	"This ring grants the wearer +4 bonus to Initiative rolls. Whenever the 
	wearer lands a hit against an undamaged enemy, it grants all companions a 
	+3 bonus on damage rolls for one round."

As of game version 1.3.4e, the damage bonus only applies if the target has 
maximum HP after a weapon hit, typically only when the damage is reduced to 
zero.  Read as written, this author believes the HP should be evaluated after 
the hit roll but before damage.  It is thus implemented here, which makes the 
ring better.
